### This project was created by create-react-app with the ---typescript flag

The purpose of this project is just to show how to implement a simple application with React and Redux using Typescript. It is probably not using the best practices in the market, but it is a good tutorial to get started.

The app is really simple, the only things that it can do are:
- Changing between dark and light mode with the button at the top-right.
- Open/Close the application drawer.
